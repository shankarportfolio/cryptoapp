    "content": "According to on-chain data from Lookonchain, the previously reported long-dormant Bitcoin OG whale has started moving the remaining 40,192 BTC, nearly $4.8 billion, to a new wallet. This coincides with a 40x short position opened by trader James Wynn and has put Bitcoin under heavy selling pressure.This is the second dump in a week after 40,000 BTC; allegedly from the same entity; was dumped to Galaxy Digital. Who is the OG whale? Is this a premeditated dump, a security breach, or a change in long-term whale behavior?Dormant BTC Wakes Up: A Satoshi Era Whale ReturnsAs noted in our earlier reports, the Bitcoin OG whale in question has coins mined between 2010 and 2011; many of which have been untouched for over 10 years. On July 16, Lookonchain confirmed the whale moved 40,192 BTC to a new address: bc1qs4.Bitcoin OG Whale Sparks FearThis followed an earlier 40,000 BTC dump to Galaxy Digital. Combined, these two dumps are over $9.5 billion in BTC that have suddenly become active after 14 years.Within hours of the whale’s transaction, Bitcoin’s price dropped from its $123k all-time high for 2025 to $116,000, a 5.7% drop. Although at the time of this publication, Bitcoin had recovered to $118,450, trading volume is down 18% over the last 24 hours.Additionally, it coincides with institutional traders reversing their position. James Wynn, a high-leverage trader, closed his 40x BTC long for a $368,120 profit and went short with the same 40x leverage. His stop loss is set at $120,142, just above the current price, which tells that he’s expecting more downside.Whale Selloffs Have Moved Markets BeforeThis isn’t the first time a Bitcoin OG whale has caused chaos. In 2020, a single transaction of 50 BTC from a Satoshi-era wallet caused a 12% drop in a matter of hours, despite being a small amount by today’s standards. What’s different in 2025 is the scale: over 80,000 BTC have been activated and possibly sent to exchanges.According to CryptoQuant, these BTC were broken into smaller tranches, split across multiple wallets and funneled into liquidity centers.Whales have in the past sold during periods of high retail activity, taking profits after long accumulation phases. With Bitcoin near its cycle top and ETFs bringing in new inflows, whales may see this as the exit window.Is This the End of the Rally or a Temporary Reset?Despite the volatility, some analysts are saying this is a healthy correction. As long as BTC holds above $117,000, it’s still in its uptrend. But if it breaks below that zone, it could trigger cascading liquidation,s especially with Wynn’s short setup.Santiment’s latest report showed elevated “whale to exchange” ratios over the last 3 days; an early sign of sell pressure. Adding to that, declining retail interest and volume.Bitcoin OG Whale Sparks FearThis narrative that BTC shakeouts just redistribute supply is one that long term holders often cling to. But even strong hands can fold if regulatory or security red flags appear.ConclusionBased on the latest research, the Bitcoin OG whale activity is creating high risk across the market. 80,000+ BTC moved in under a week and James Wynn’s 40x short position has amplified the bearish pressure as Bitcoin hit new highs.Technicals still look good for the bigger picture but the market structure is fragile and sentiment depends on if this selloff continues or stalls.For in-depth analysis and the latest trends in the crypto space, our team offers expert content regularly.SummaryThe previously reported Bitcoin OG whale has moved 80,192 BTC this week and people are worried about more selling. On-chain data shows these Satoshi-era funds worth over $9.5 billion are moving to exchanges. James Wynn has gone bearish and opened a 40x short above current prices. Bitcoin has dropped from $123k to $118k with 18% less volume. FAQsWhat is a Bitcoin OG whale?A Bitcoin OG whale is an early Bitcoin holder, usually from the Satoshi era (2009–2011), with large holdings from early mining or transactions.Who is James Wynn?James Wynn is a high-leverage trader who makes big directional bets. His recent 40x short is bearish on Bitcoin.Is the BTC transfer a hack?No confirmation but some experts like Coinbase’s Conor Grogan think it could be compromised keys.What happens if Bitcoin drops below $116K?If BTC drops below $116,000, the market could see cascading liquidations and the next support zone is $112,500.GlossaryBitcoin OG Whale – An early adopter who holds a large amount of BTC, typically acquired before 2012.40x Short – A leveraged bet where a trader profits if the asset price falls, multiplied 40 times.Dormant Wallet – A crypto wallet that has not transacted for several years.Liquidation Price – The price at which a leveraged position is automatically closed to prevent further losses.On-chain Analytics – Blockchain data analysis to track wallet activity, volume and flows.SourcesLookonchainCryptotimes",

That first operation led to drug convictions for several UK suspects. A picture of Paul Chowles. Source: CPS UKNCA officer moved Silk Road BTCIn 2014, investigators launched a 2nd phase that uncovered “Silk Road 2.0,” set up by Thomas White within one month of the FBI’s closure of the Silk Road. White later received a 64-month prison sentence in April 2019. In that team, Chowles was responsible for analyzing and extracting crypto and data from White’s devices. According to the records, 50 BTC out of 97 BTC taken from White’s “retirement wallet” were moved in two large transfers to another public address from May 6 – 7, 2017. Those coins were then split into smaller sums and run through “Bitcoin Fog,” a known money‐laundering mixer, before being transferred to other wallets to obscure their origin.Once the trail was blurred, Chowles converted some of the BTC into pounds and withdrew cash. He also set up accounts with Cryptopay and Wirex, using their debit cards to spend and withdraw funds. From August 26, 2021, until May 20, 2022. He made 279 purchases totaling £23,309 on his Cryptopay card. He also made five cash withdrawals amounting to £6,232 from August 30, 2021 until February 22, 2022. Meanwhile, his Wirex card racked up transactions adding up to £79,884.77 from August 27, 2021 to July 14, 2021.The flow of stolen BTC. Source: ChainalysisAltogether, Chowles profited by £613,147.29 from his criminal actions, according to the investigators. Today, the market value of the total stolen BTC exceeds £4.4 million.Chowles confessed to his crime at Liverpool Crown Court in May 2025. He pleaded guilty to various charges, including thievery and transfers and concealment of criminal funds. Finally, he received a sentence of 5.5 years on July 16.White helped nab Paul ChowlesAfter White’s 97 Bitcoins were seized, investigators first thought he had removed the 50 tokens by himself. By late 2021, the missing Bitcoins were written off as lost. Later, during investigations, White pointed out that only someone inside the NCA with access to his private keys could have taken the missing coins. Merseyside officers, who manage White’s license, met NCA colleagues, including Chowles, to review the case. It was at that meeting that their attention turned towards the stolen 50 Bitcoins.An investigation by Merseyside Police followed, leading to Chowles’s arrest. Officers seized his iPhone, linking him to the transfer account, and showed browser history for a crypto exchange. They also found notebooks in his office containing details such as statements, usernames, and passwords, tied to White’s accounts.According to specialist prosecutor Alex Johnson, Chowles was someone with a competent and technical mind who had great knowledge of crypto and the dark net. Johnson added, “He abused that trust to fill his own pockets.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass. Save Your Spot",

    "content": "Mysterious Bitcoin Whale Strikes Again! Thousands of Bitcoin Moved to a Different Address! Is a Sale Coming? The OG Bitcoin whale, considered one of the oldest and most mysterious asset holders in the crypto world, is on the move again. The “OG Bitcoin whale,” considered one of the crypto world's oldest and most mysterious asset holders, is back on the move after 14 years of silence. “OG Bitcoin Whale” Awakes After 14 Years, Moves Another 40,000 BTC: Is He Preparing to Sell? According to blockchain data, 40,192 BTC (approximately $4.75 billion) was transferred from whale addresses to a new address early this morning. This mysterious whale first moved approximately 80,000 BTC ($9.5 billion) across eight different addresses on July 4, 2025. These transfers, each containing 10,000 BTC, caused a stir in the crypto community. Two days earlier, 40,010 of these BTC were sent to two addresses identified by chain analysis firm Arkham as belonging to Galaxy Digital. Some of the funds were later distributed to crypto exchange OKX and unlabeled addresses. The remainder remains held in Galaxy Digital addresses. New Transfer: Sell Signal? As of 4:33 AM today, the remaining 40,192 BTC, previously distributed equally across four different addresses (“bc1qn”, “bc1qy”, “bc1qm”, “1GcCK”), were consolidated into a new address (“bc1qs...”). Prior to the transfer, test transactions of 1 BTC were conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday. According to analytics firm Lookonchain, this new consolidation move could indicate the whale is planning to continue selling. Galaxy Digital’s OTC (over-the-counter) services allow users to sell large amounts of crypto privately without sending them directly to exchanges. Who Could Be the Whale? While various theories circulate regarding the identity of this mysterious whale, from Roger Ver to the CIA and even Satoshi Nakamoto, Coinbase executive Conor Grogan states that the whale was likely an early Bitcoin miner in 2011. At the time, the block reward was 50 BTC and there was much less competition on the network. *This is not investment advice.",

David Sacks, Trump’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar, has been working on “budget-neutral” strategies for acquiring bitcoin while bitcoin and crypto-backing senator Cynthia Lummis, a champion of the bitcoin reserve who has introduced bitcoin acquistion bills to Congress, has said that following the passage of the stablecoin and market structure bills, the Trump administration will then turn to the bitcoin reserve. “Investors are watching closely for signs of a policy shift that could unleash the next wave of inflows,” Rodriguez-Alarcon added. “Crypto Week is a historic moment for both Bitcoin and crypto as a whole,” Dom Harz, cofounder of bitcoin layer two network BOB, said in emailed comments. “With bitcoin breaking past $122,000 over the weekend, a new all-time high, the price is reflecting the convergence of increased institutional inflows, growing confidence in digital assets as foundational infrastructure, and importantly, a call for regulatory clarity.”",

    "content": "The US Marshals Service (USMS) appears to hold just under 29,000 Bitcoin, far lower than the more than 200,000 BTC many believed the government had in custody.The updated figure, confirmed via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by independent crypto journalist L0la L33tz on July 16, puts the government’s total at 28,988 BTC as of March 2025.At current prices, that stash is worth roughly $3.4 billion. That starkly contrasts with the $23.5 billion estimate from blockchain analytics platforms like Arkham Intelligence and Bitcoin Treasuries.The discrepancy has ignited speculation across the crypto space, with some observers questioning whether the US has been quietly selling its Bitcoin holdings.[Editor’s Note: Given that President Trump announced that seized Bitcoin would become part of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve earlier this year, it is also possible that the Bitcoin is simply no longer under US Marshals custody. However, who controls the keys for the Bitcoin tracked onchain remains unclear.]Is the US selling its Bitcoin?Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey suggested the US likely sold significant portions of its BTC reserves before President Donald Trump’s swearing-in in January. He noted that the lack of visible on-chain activity may not prove anything due to custodial involvement.He stated:“I think it is conclusive they’ve been selling without creating onchain footprint.”Bitcoin analyst Sani, who tracks addresses suspected to be linked to US government wallets, confirmed no recent transactions from those addresses.However, he pointed out that if custodians like Coinbase were facilitating off-chain swaps, traditional blockchain tracking may no longer clarify government activity.Sani added:“If that’s truly what’s happening, then all the on-chain tracking we’ve been doing, mine included, might not matter anymore.”Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal advocate for a national Bitcoin reserve, responded with concern to this development. She said:“If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race.”Seized vs. forfeited BitcoinL33tz clarified that the FOIA request only covered “forfeited” Bitcoin assets legally transferred to government ownership.According to her, many seized assets, such as those tied to ongoing investigations or hacks like Bitfinex, are not yet government property and may reside with other federal agencies like the DEA or FBI.She emphasized that platforms like Arkham may misrepresent totals by lumping together seized and forfeited coins. L33tz pointed out:“For example, Arkham lists 94k BTC from the Bitfinex hack, but forfeiture in the Bitfinex case hasnt been decided, at least last time I checked.”Blockchain security expert Taylor Monahan also offered further explanation, pointing out that legal custody does not equal ownership.She noted that in many cases, seized coins remain victims’ property and will never become US government assets.Monahan highlighted ongoing legal processes, ranging from civil forfeiture to IEEPA, determining the fate of seized property.She cited several examples, including a case where the FBI currently holds $40 million in crypto linked to an August 2024 theft, but these coins are expected to be returned to the rightful owner under the terms of a plea agreement.Considering this, Monhan stated:“Most of the time the coins seized by USG do not become property of the USG. They are returned to the victim that was hacked or defrauded.”The post US Marshalls ‘forfeited’ Bitcoin stash may be $20B smaller than estimated, raising eyebrows about reserve appeared first on CryptoSlate.",

    "content": "Convano , a publicly traded Japanese firm, has announced a strategic move to bolster its digital asset portfolio by acquiring approximately $2.7 million worth of Bitcoin in July. This initiative underscores the company’s commitment to integrating cryptocurrency as a core component of its financial reserves. By adopting a Bitcoin reserve strategy, Convano aims to diversify its asset base and leverage the potential long-term value appreciation of digital currencies. The decision reflects a growing trend among institutional investors in Japan to embrace cryptocurrency adoption within corporate treasury management. Convano’s planned purchase aligns with broader market dynamics where companies seek to hedge against traditional market volatility through exposure to blockchain-based assets. This measured approach highlights the increasing legitimacy of Bitcoin as a reserve asset in the Asian financial landscape. Market analysts view Convano’s move as a prudent step towards enhancing balance sheet resilience amid evolving economic conditions. The company’s transparent disclosure of its Bitcoin acquisition plan may also encourage other listed entities to consider similar strategies, potentially accelerating institutional participation in the crypto market.",

However, his freedom soon became entangled with a complex international legal framework. To avoid extradition, Ver – supported by his legal team – filed a causa with the Corte Europea dei Diritti dell’Uomo in the month of May. The legal action claims that Spain has violated the garanzie giuridiche guaranteed by the European jurisdiction, choosing to follow up on the U.S. request without due respect for the rules on the protection of individual rights. The judicial implications for the cryptocurrency community The Ver affair represents an emblematic case of the growing challenges that the Bitcoin world and, more generally, that of cryptocurrencies , are facing. With the ever-wider spread of digital assets , the attention of international tax authorities is also increasing, as is the complexity of the regulations to which operators, investors, and evangelists are subjected. The Ver case not only involves the individual dimension of the single crypto-entrepreneur but also raises questions about the effectiveness of international regulatory mechanisms and the protection of the rights of operators in the sector. The legal action filed with the European Court of Human Rights The lawyer of Roger Ver emphasized that the appeal was formally filed with the European Court of Human Rights in May, a few days after the decision by the Spanish authorities to accept the American request for extradition. The core of the dispute revolves around the alleged violation by Spain of the procedural safeguards guaranteed by the European system, which are fundamental to ensure that no citizen is extradited without adequate guarantees regarding fair trial and protection of human rights. Roger Ver: from Bitcoin Jesus to protagonist of an international legal challenge The figure of Roger Ver has been a symbol of the revolution introduced by Bitcoin and its potential for years. However, the current legal battle marks a significant turning point both for his personal history and for the debate around the adoption of cryptocurrencies on a global scale. His stay in Majorca , thanks to the payment of bail after his arrest, places him in a position of waiting and, at the same time, of active resistance against the international judicial system. The stakes for Spain and for Europe The appeal at the European Court of Human Rights does not concern only the personal destinies of Ver, but it calls into question the role of Spain in the European context. A potential rejection of the extradition procedure could strengthen the centrality of tutele individuali in the application of international-level judicial measures, while a confirmation would pave the way for new interpretations of collaboration between countries in the fight against tax evasion. In any case, the choice of the court represents a precedent destined to impact future disputes of a similar nature, especially when they involve digital assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem The outcome of the lawsuit filed by Roger Ver against Spagna will be closely watched by investors, entrepreneurs, and analysts. As a result, the decision of the European Court of Human Rights could influence not only his extradition to Los Angeles, but also the perception of legal security within the European Union for those who operate with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In this scenario, the theme of the necessity for clear and uniform regulations emerges strongly, capable of combining the protection of rights with effective tools for the prevention of tax and financial crimes. The impacts on regulation and public debate Although the legal case is still unfolding, it can already be stated that the trial against Roger Ver has shone a spotlight on the delicate balance between national sovereignty, international rules, and financial innovation . The outcome of the procedure before the European Court of Human Rights could influence, in the future, the policies adopted both in Spain and in other European countries. In the meantime, industry operators and observers continue to question how to ensure transparency and accountability without stifling the innovation brought by new digital assets . Bitcoin to the test: a turning point for international justice The case involving Roger Ver and Spain marks a turning point in the history of cryptocurrency regulation in Europe and worldwide. At the intersection of European legal principles, the need to combat tax evasion, and the defense of innovation, a fundamental game is being played for the future of Bitcoin and digital finance. The developments of the affair will inevitably become a reference point for the entire comunità crypto and for the institutions that increasingly find themselves having to govern the complexity of future markets. Staying informed, analyzing the choices of the courts, and participating in the public debate will be essential to fully grasp the impact of these decisions and to contribute to the definition of a more transparent and secure ecosystem for everyone.

    "content": "The crypto market is experiencing an unexpected turnaround. While Bitcoin is losing ground, Ethereum registers a spectacular increase of 24% in one week. A dynamic that draws the attention of investors and crypto analysts! We tell you more in the following paragraphs. Listed Companies Rush to Ethereum: A Strong Signal for Crypto Institutional purchases undeniably boost the crypto asset Ethereum: Sharplink Gaming agency has injected 225 million dollars into the second largest crypto, bringing its portfolio to 280,000 ETH. Meanwhile, BitMine now holds more than 500 million dollars in Ethereum. These signs are clear: listed companies are diversifying their exposure by moving away from traditional Bitcoin. Some analyses even point out that ETH is regaining momentum after two years of underperformance. CoinGecko data confirms this dynamic with a price at $3,460 . This represents a five-month high. The rise is also accompanied by renewed participation in derivatives. Proof of this: open interest on ETH futures reaches unprecedented highs since last December. Ethereum Attracts with Its Staking Potential and a More Favorable Regulatory Environment Another driver supports Ethereum’s rise : optimism around staking ETFs . Since May, the SEC has appeared more open. The American crypto regulator argues that staking activities do not fall under securities regulations. This position quickly sparked a wave of positive anticipation within the crypto ecosystem! The contrast with Bitcoin is striking. The flagship crypto shows a slight decline over the last 24 hours. Its increased volatility and political uncertainties weigh on its appeal. Conversely, Ethereum seems to benefit from a convergence of regulation, innovation, and adoption. The shift in favor of Ethereum thus raises questions about the hierarchy of crypto assets. Time will tell if this is a simple rebound or a lasting paradigm shift for the market. For now, some predictions already count on an ETH at 1.5 million dollars .",

    "content": "Bitcoin recently reached a new all-time high (ATH) but encountered a brief pullback as the market overheated. However, with the resilience in the ETF market, Bitcoin has largely returned to normalcy. With substantial ETF inflows, Bitcoin’s price could soon push past its previous ATH. Bitcoin is Ready To Bounce Back The Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Ratio spiked earlier this month, following a similar spike in June. The NVT Ratio measures the relationship between the network value and transaction activity. A rising NVT Ratio suggests the network value was exceeding the transaction activity, which generally is a sign of the market overheating. This tends to result in a reversal. The same was evident in Bitcoin’s recent dip, as the market cooled off. Nevertheless, currently, the NVT Ratio has returned to a monthly low, providing Bitcoin with room for a potential rally. This week, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw over $1.5 billion in inflows, a significant portion of which occurred in the last 48 hours during Bitcoin’s dip. The influx of institutional money highlights that investors are confident in Bitcoin’s potential despite the market cooling. These ETF inflows demonstrate resilience among institutional investors, who are continuing to add Bitcoin to their portfolios rather than sell. If this trend persists, it could propel Bitcoin’s price upward, as institutional support provides stability. BTC Price Is Inches From The All-Time High Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,325, facing resistance at the $120,000 level. This resistance is crucial for Bitcoin if it wants to break back to its ATH of $123,218. The 4.1% gap to reach the ATH indicates potential for growth, but Bitcoin needs to secure support above $120,000 for this to happen. If Bitcoin can hold above $120,000 and push past $122,000, it could continue its ascent toward new all-time highs. The current market conditions and ETF inflows support a bullish outlook, with a significant chance of breaking the resistance. However, the risk of profit-taking remains, which could lead to a price drop. If Bitcoin faces selling pressure, it could fall back to $115,000, erasing a portion of recent gains. This would invalidate the bullish thesis, causing Bitcoin to retest lower support levels.",

Conclusion .post-accordion-wrapper .accordion-content { max-height: 0; overflow: hidden; } One of the key conditions for making cryptocurrencies part of everyday life is having convenient entry and exit points. Today, we’re exploring crypto cards — a powerful tool that allows you to convert digital assets into fiat, use them for everyday payments, and even access credit lines backed by your crypto holdings.This article was prepared by Incrypted for educational purposes. We hope it helps you better understand and navigate the crypto landscape.Card nameCard typeWhere availableTrustee PlusMasterCardEEABybit CardMasterCardEEA, UK, Argentina, Brazil, AIFC, AustraliaCoinbase Card CoinbaseVisaUSACrypto.com Visa CardVisaEEA, USA, Brazil, Singapure, Canada, Australiam, UKWirex cardMasterCardEEA, UK, AustraliaBitPay crypto debit cardMasterCardUSACL Card Powered by LedgerVisaEEA, UKNexo CardMasterCardEEA, UKGate CardVisaEEAMetaMask CardMasterCardEEA, UK, Brazil, Mexico, ColombiaGnosis PayVisaEEAGemini Credit CardMasterCardUSAWhat Is a Crypto Card and How Does It Work?A crypto card is a payment tool that allows you to use cryptocurrency for everyday purchases and transactions — just like a traditional bank card.Since cryptocurrencies aren’t recognized as legal tender in most countries, and crypto payment processing is still limited to select merchants, crypto cards bridge the gap by converting digital assets into fiat at the point of sale.Here’s how it typically works:You top up your card account with crypto via the issuer’s platform.When you make a purchase, the issuer automatically deducts the necessary amount in crypto and converts it into fiat currency.The fiat payment is then processed through a traditional payment network, just like any other card transaction.That said, the exact mechanics can vary depending on the provider. Some platforms offer built-in converters, requiring users to manually exchange crypto into fiat to maintain a card balance.This brings us to a key point: the issuer is the heart of any crypto card product. They determine crucial factors like fees, geographic availability, supported currencies, and how crypto-to-fiat conversion is handled.What to Consider When Choosing a Crypto Card?There are dozens of crypto cards on the market today, each offering different features and issued by various companies. To help you navigate the options, here are the key factors to consider when choosing the right card for your needs:Issuer credibility: Regulation, trust, and reputation are essential. Check whether the company has experienced security breaches or whether users have faced issues with card usage, crypto deposits, or withdrawals.Conversion method: As mentioned earlier, some cards convert crypto to fiat automatically at the time of purchase, while others require manual conversion. This has a direct impact on how convenient the card is to use. Conversion typically happens through the issuer’s own platform or a partnered exchange.Fees: Since crypto payments often involve multiple intermediaries, transaction fees may include card issuer fees, payment processor charges, and potentially crypto-to-fiat conversion costs.Note: You may also encounter fixed fees for card issuance or maintenance. Additionally, hidden fees may be baked into unfavorable exchange rates.Payment network provider: Most crypto cards are issued in partnership with Visa or Mastercard, and less commonly with UnionPay or other networks. This can affect where and how the card can be used, as some merchants only accept specific providers.Supported cryptocurrencies: Typically, crypto card providers support only a limited number of digital assets. This may require users to pre-convert their funds. Be sure the issuer allows you to fund the card with cryptocurrencies that are convenient for you.Next, we’ll review 12 popular crypto cards from leading issuers to help you determine which one best fits your needs for withdrawing and spending digital assets in everyday life.Top 12 Crypto Cards for Everyday SpendingThe most crypto-friendly regulations for card issuance are currently found in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United States. As a result, most crypto card issuers focus on serving one of these regions — and only occasionally offer global support.The main providers of crypto cards fall into two categories: cryptocurrency exchanges, which already have robust systems for storing user funds and converting crypto to fiat, and specialized fintech platforms that offer payment infrastructure built around digital assets.Trustee Plus Card typeDebit MasterCardCurrencies supportedEUR, BTC, ETH, USDT, SOLWhere availableEEAFees0.5% crypto conversion fee, ATM withdrawals 1.5% + 1EURCashbackUp to 30% cashback on feesReferral Programа45%Official Websitehttps://trusteeglobal.com/Trustee Plus is a digital asset management platform best known for its mobile app — available on both the App Store and Google Play. The app functions as a secure multi-currency crypto wallet, offering instant exchanges and built-in tools for buying and selling crypto with fiat currencies.Thanks to a partnership between Trustee Plus and Quicko, users can now spend crypto in everyday life with ease. All you need is a Quicko Digital Card — a virtual payment card that enables seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions.Though the Quicko Digital Card is issued via the standalone Quicko Digitall app, it integrates directly with your Trustee Plus account, allowing for smooth and convenient crypto payments.How to Get Started with the Quicko Digital Card:Register an account in the Trustee Plus app. Learn more here.Verify your identity (KYC) using a valid document — such as an ID card, passport, or residence permit.Top up your Trustee Plus account with euros or supported cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, USDT, or USDC.Download the Quicko Digital app (available on the App Store and Google Play and sign up using the same phone number linked to your Trustee Plus account.After that, you’ll need to sync your accounts across both apps.

There are no maintenance fees, and transaction fees are 0%. Top-ups from your Trustee Plus balance are also free of charge. The card is valid for 5 years.Another standout feature of Trustee Plus is the option to obtain a personal euro IBAN — a Polish bank account that can be activated for just €1. Once set up, it functions as a full-fledged European account: you can top it up from your regular bank accounts or by exchanging crypto for euros directly within the app. From this IBAN, you can send transfers to any account within the EU, with a per-transaction limit of up to €5,000 — significantly higher than the limits of the standard Quicko card.This feature works as a powerful complement to the virtual card and is ideal for larger transactions, such as property purchases, paying for services, and more.Important: As of May 20, 2025, Trustee Plus has temporarily suspended new applications from residents of Ukraine. However, the service remains available to Ukrainian citizens who are currently located within the EU. To use it, you simply need to verify a residential address within the European Economic Area (EEA).Bybit CardCard typePayment (debit)Currencies supportedBTC, ETH, XRP, TON, USDT, USDC, MNT, BNBWhere availableEEA, UK, Argentina, Brazil, AIFC, AustraliaFees1% fee for fiat currency exchange, 0.9% fee for cryptocurrency exchange, 2% fee for cash withdrawals (0% fee up to $150 per month)Cashback2% to 10% cashback for the first 30 days (for new users)Bybit Card — launched in partnership with the UK-based payment infrastructure provider Moorwand, operating under a Mastercard license.The card is linked directly to the user’s exchange balance and automatically converts cryptocurrency to fiat for payments.Coinbase CardCard typePayment (debit)Currencies supportedBTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and all cryptocurrencies traded on Coinbase + USDWhere availableUSA (except Hawaii)FeesNoneCashback0.5% fee in cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH)Coinbase Card is a crypto card offered by the US-regulated exchange Coinbase.

Due to the lack of a regulatory framework, crypto cards are currently unavailable in Ukraine. However, the Ukrainian neobank Trustee Plus offers crypto cards for Ukrainian citizens that can be issued within the European Economic Area. This situation is likely to change once the \"Virtual Assets\" law comes into effect. What is a crypto card in simple terms? A crypto card is similar to a bank card but allows you to use cryptocurrency to pay for goods and services. The card issuer converts the digital assets from your balance into fiat currency, after which the payment is processed through a payment infrastructure provider such as Visa or Mastercard. Which card is better for withdrawing cryptocurrency? You can withdraw cryptocurrency to either a crypto card or a regular bank card. In the latter case, you will need to use an exchange service, a P2P platform, or a crypto exchange to convert your cryptocurrency into fiat currency beforehand. How to withdraw money from cryptocurrencies? It depends on where and how you store your cryptocurrency. Users of crypto exchanges can withdraw funds via built-in off-ramp services, while holders of non-custodial wallets can exchange crypto for fiat through P2P platforms or exchangers. For crypto card holders, the card issuer acts as the intermediary for the conversion. What types of cryptocurrencies exist? Cryptocurrencies are generally divided into three main categories: Bitcoin — the primary cryptocurrency for storing and preserving value; stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies; and altcoins — tokens and coins of individual crypto projects and companies. Each group is further subdivided into several subcategories.

    "description": "A new U.S. bill might finally make your crypto count in mortgage checks.",
    "content": "Key Takeaways Despite a rocky crypto week in Washington, a new mortgage bill signals a step toward legitimizing Bitcoin in traditional lending. At the same time, nations such as El Salvador and Pakistan are embracing cryptocurrency on a national level. Following a disappointing start to the much-anticipated ‘Crypto Week’ in Washington, marked by the failure of a key procedural vote, lawmakers are still pushing forward with fresh proposals. One notable development came from Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who introduced a new bill, H.R. 4374, on 14th July 2025. What is the bill aiming at? For perspective, the newly proposed U.S. House bill seeks to modernize mortgage evaluations by updating federal underwriting systems. If passed, lenders would be required to consider crypto assets, specifically those held in brokerage accounts linked to exchanges, when reviewing mortgage applications. The bill has been referred to the House Financial Services and Veterans Affairs Committees for review. Though still in its early stages, the legislation aims to make crypto holdings part of mainstream mortgage assessments. What changes will come once it’s enacted? If enacted, the bill would modernize mortgage underwriting by allowing borrowers to count Bitcoin [BTC] and other digital assets held in registered brokerage accounts toward loan qualifications. Currently, applicants must convert crypto into fiat and hold it for a set period before it’s considered. This legislation would remove that requirement, letting digital assets directly meet reserve and repayment criteria without liquidation. The proposal builds on momentum from FHFA Director Bill Pulte’s June 2025 announcement to include crypto in mortgage evaluations. Notably, ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood praised the move, saying it could boost Bitcoin’s role in mainstream finance and help younger, crypto-savvy buyers qualify for home loans. How is it beneficial for the Veterans? On top of that, as mentioned above, the bill also proposes changes for the Department of Veterans Affairs. This could enable veterans to count their digital assets when applying for VA-backed mortgages. While the proposed mortgage bill still awaits debate and approval in both the House and Senate, requiring President Donald Trump’s signature to become law, the U.S. remains caught in a tug-of-war over Bitcoin legislation. Meanwhile, unexpected developments on the global stage are reshaping the crypto narrative. Pakistan and El Salvador, two countries rarely mentioned in the same economic breath, have formed a historic partnership centered on cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin. Their agreement aims to explore crypto’s use in public sector utilities and expand their BTC reserves. What’s more? Although ‘Crypto Week’ in Washington didn’t yield breakthroughs, Republicans succeeded in passing the sweeping ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking Senate vote. The contrast underscores a growing divide: while U.S. lawmakers remain split on Bitcoin’s role in finance, other countries are moving quickly to embrace its potential. Share Tweet",

BTC-S Combines Bitcoin Power With Solana Speed In One Chain Presale Nears Final Weeks with Explosive Numbers Bitcoin Solaris is now deep into Phase 12 of its presale. At $12 per token, with the next phase ticking up to $13, and a launch price set at $20, the math speaks for itself. Potential returns hover around 150%. Only around 2 weeks remain before the gates close. Over $7.2M has already been raised, and more than 15,000 unique users have locked in their spots. Unlike XRP’s slower build, Bitcoin Solaris’ presale is moving fast, fueled by clear demand and solid fundamentals. This presale is already being called one of the most aggressive and successful in recent crypto history. Wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for receiving tokens on launch day. Bitcoin Solaris emphasizes these wallets for their reliability and seamless integration. Reward System Driving Long-Term Confidence Bitcoin Solaris’ rewards distribution sets it apart from most presales. This isn’t just about mining. Contributors are rewarded through multiple streams: 40% goes to Base Layer miners. 25% support Solaris Layer validators. 20% is directed to stakers (BTC-S holders). 10% funds ongoing development. 5% support community initiatives. Rewards scale based on contribution, time-weighted participation, and task complexity, ensuring fairness and sustainability. Transparency is baked in with public dashboards and reports. You can explore this in detail in the Technical Rewards Structure. Roadmap Highlights Future Growth Potential Bitcoin Solaris isn’t stopping post-launch. The roadmap shows a clear and ambitious future: Testnet, wallet launches, and security audits are in progress. Mainnet launch with AI-optimized Solaris Nova App expected by Q3 2026. Future expansions include layer-2 scaling, cross-chain compatibility, and institutional partnerships. See the detailed Roadmap Here. Conclusion XRP may still hold promise, but Bitcoin Solaris offers immediacy, clarity, and serious upside potential in the coming months.

    "content": "Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis reacts to reports that the United States government has sold more than 80% of its Bitcoin stash, referring to the move as a strategic blunder. Yesterday, the crypto community was stirred by reports claiming that the U.S. government had offloaded a significant portion of its nearly 200,000 BTC stash. Some sources stated that the sale had reduced the government’s Bitcoin holdings to just 28,988 BTC, an 85% drop from the 198,012 BTC it held earlier this year. Senator Lummis Reacts For context, the reports emerged after a FOIA response from the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) surfaced online, suggesting that the agency held roughly 29,000 BTC. US Government Current Bitcoin Holdings Meanwhile, the claims that the U.S. government has sold most of its Bitcoin holdings misinterpret the FOIA response. While the response indicated that USMS holds roughly 29,000 BTC, on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows the U.S. government still has approximately 200,000 BTC. The government obtained these assets through criminal and civil forfeitures. Tracked public wallets indicate that the government still holds a total of 198,012 Bitcoin, currently worth $23.49 billion. The U.S. plans to retain them for several years, anticipating a future price increase and using the proceeds to help offset national debt.. President Donald Trump outlined this strategy while signing an executive order earlier this year. He ordered the BTC tokens to be held in a strategic reserve. Interestingly, Trump intends to grow the U.S. Bitcoin stash over the years through budget-neutral ways. Per the order, the president directed the Commerce and Treasury departments to propose ways the government can acquire more BTC without incurring any costs to taxpayers. In the meantime, the government’s portfolio is currently worth $24.25 billion. It comprises multiple crypto assets, including 347 million USDT, 59,951 ETH ($202.14 million), 750 wBTC ($88.94 million), and 40,293 BNB ($28.7 million). Journalist Addresses Misrepresentation of FOIA Response However, Lola L33tz, the independent journalist who filed the FOIA request, addressed the public misinterpretation of the USMS response, particularly the reference to Arkham Intelligence data, which indicates that the U.S. government still holds roughly 200,000 BTC. Lola clarified the distinction between seized and forfeited crypto assets. She explained that seized assets are held by law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI, following court-authorized actions. In contrast, forfeited assets have been legally declared government property, typically through judicial rulings or settlements. Essentially, the remaining Bitcoin is likely still under seizure but not yet forfeited, which explains why it is not in USMS custody or included in the FOIA disclosure. Notably, Lola emphasized that the USMS is the primary custodian of forfeited Bitcoin, not all government-held BTC. “This doesn’t mean that the U.S. government has sold any Bitcoin,” Lola added. “It just means that whatever these U.S. Treasury sites estimate is likely wrong, as they don’t seem to differentiate between seized and forfeited coins.”",

    "content": "The asset manager is on an accumulation streak, topping up its holdings as its BTC-tracking exchange-traded fund thrives. BlackRock has purchased another $416 million of Bitcoin, according to data from the blockchain intelligence platform Arkham. The buy, estimated to be around 3,478 BTC based on prices at the time of acquisition, continues a month-long accumulation streak that included a $216 million addition just over a week ago. The latest move lifts the firm’s giant portfolio to approximately 716,500 BTC, worth roughly $85.4 billion at current prices. This translates to 3.6% of the entire circulating Bitcoin supply, making BlackRock one of the largest holders globally. BLACKROCK IS BUYING $BTC BlackRock just bought $416M of Bitcoin. Current Holdings: $85.47B BTC (3.6% of circulating supply) pic.twitter.com/Xer5d1R4XK BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation comes as demand for IBIT continues to grow, leading the broader U.S.-listed spot BTC ETFs in daily inflows. In the latest, the ETFs recorded a combined $799.4 million, per SoSoValue data. Once again dominated by IBIT with a lion’s share of approximately $764 million, the inflows extended the funds’ winning streak to ten days. The surge in demand comes as Bitcoin itself reaches new highs, recently breaking above $123,000 during the latest market rally. The streak of wins has positioned the funds as the best-performing in recent months, topping global charts since April alongside their Ethereum counterparts. These spot crypto ETFs recorded $20 billion in inflows during this period, more than any other ETF category. Analysts credit the surge in spot ETF demand as the key driver behind Bitcoin’s rally, fueling a steadier stream of capital into the market. Unlike past runs powered by retail speculation, Bitcoin ETFs are bringing in consistent institutional flows that provide stronger, more sustainable support. Expectations for the positive inflows trend to continue are driving bold price forecasts for BTC, with predictions rolling that the asset giant could reach $200,000 by year-end. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at slightly over $118,620, up roughly 1% over the past day.",

    "description": "CoinGecko’s Q2 2025 report shows a 24% market cap rebound to $3.5 trillion, Bitcoin’s new all‐time high, record DEX volumes and Circle’s 864% IPO surge.",
    "content": "CoinGecko’s newly released 2025 Q2 Crypto Industry Report paints a portrait of a market in rebound, yet one still wrestling with evolving trading dynamics beneath the surface. After posting an 18.6% drawdown in Q1, total market capitalization climbed 24.0% in Q2, clawing back $663.6 billion to close the period at $3.5 trillion, narrowly missing its January peak.Market Recovery Masks Lingering Volume WeaknessDespite the dramatic recovery in valuations, trading activity on centralized venues continued its retreat. Average daily spot volumes on CEXs fell by 26.2% quarter‐on‐quarter (from $146.0 billion in Q1 to $107.8 billion in Q2), while total spot trading on major exchanges tumbled 27.7% to $3.9 trillion.Binance, though still the top spot exchange with roughly 37–39% market share, saw volumes dip below $500 billion in both April and June. Only MEXC (+3.7%), HTX (+5.4%) and Bitget (+3.0%) bucked the broader decline, pushing Crypto.com out of second place after its volume plunged 61.4%.Bitcoin Leads the ChargeBitcoin’s resurgence was the story of Q2. BTC not only reclaimed the six‐figure mark but also set a fresh all‐time high before closing the quarter above $100,000. Fueled by that rally, its market dominance climbed to 62.1%, up 3.0 percentage points from Q1 and 7.6 points since January.Ethereum, the strongest performer among the top altcoins, jumped 36.4%—from $1,805 to $2,488—but remains well below its 2025 open of $3,337. ETH dominance inched up to 8.8%, while the combined “Others” bucket shrank to 13.7%, underscoring a wider struggle for altcoin capital inflows.A Landmark IPO Sparks Fresh EnthusiasmCrypto’s first marquee public offering of 2025 added to the bullish headlines. On June 5, Circle (NYSE: CRCL) debuted at $31 per share, and promptly saw demand outstrip supply by over 25 times. After closing its first trading day at $83.23, CRCL more than tripled to an intraday high of $298.99 on June 23, marking an 864.5% premium to its IPO price. Circle’s blockbuster listing has revived hopes for other big‐name token issuers, including Kraken, Gemini and Grayscale, to follow suit on public markets.Decentralized Venues Shine as Traders DiversifyPerhaps the most seismic shift reported came in trading behavior. As CEX volumes waned, DEXes boasted record quarter‐on‐quarter growth: spot volume leapt 25.3% to $876.3 billion, driving the DEX‐to‐CEX ratio to an all‐time high of 0.23. PancakeSwap emerged as the star performer, skyrocketing 539.2% to $392.6 billion, its dominance buoyed by the launch of Binance Alpha routing order flow into BSC.Meanwhile, Solana‐based DEXes such as Orca, Meteora and Raydium each saw volume declines north of 40%, reflecting waning interest in SOL‐chain trading. Perpetual futures trading on DEXes also hit new heights. Q2 perp volume climbed to $898.0 billion, led by Hyperliquid’s commanding 72.7% share.It is equivalent to $653.2 billion in activity and cementing its place as the eighth‐largest perp venue across both centralized and decentralized platforms. Upstarts like Aster (formerly APX Finance) doubled volumes after launching a “Pro” mode, while legacy players such as dYdX saw monthly averages slide to just $5.3 billion—half their January levels.What Lies Ahead?CoinGecko’s full 50‐slide deck offers a granular look at each sector, ranging from DeFi and NFT ecosystems to side‐by‐side performance of top CEX and DEX operators. The report suggests that, even as asset prices rebound, the trading landscape is shifting decisively: liquidity is fragmenting away from centralized incumbents toward permissionless, on‐chain venues.For investors, traders and service providers alike, the message is clear: Q2 delivered not just a recovery in valuations but a transformation in how participants access and move capital across crypto markets.

Whales and institutions hence usually use OTC trades to prevent slippage, and keep their footprint in the market small. This allows large transactions to be conducted without moving market prices abruptly. Satoshi-Era Coins: Why It Matters Dormant Wallets and Market Psychology The Satoshi era Bitcoin dormant wallets dating back to before 2011 have a mythical mark in the crypto. Anytime they do this, the suspicions rise about who actually created Bitcoin in the first place, with rumors of Satoshi Nakamoto and his or her enigmatic personality or the concern that old insecure storage systems have had their keys hacked into. Although there is no direct testimony to the fact that this wallet belonged to Satoshi, himself, the very fact that it was left unspoiled after over 14 years has given it the cloak of mystery. The coins of the wallet were no doubt mined when the value of Bitcoin was less than $0.10 and it is a good reminder of the fortunes that early enthusiasts have earned Similar activity was recently observed in Coinbase executive Conor Grogan who said that abandoned wallets of more than a billion dollars could be caused by stolen keys. But here, a direct movement to Galaxy Digital indicates the organized probably legal sale instead of criminal activity. Who Is Behind the Transfer? Although the actual owner of the wallet is still not known, there are indications that the owner is highly capable and connected affair. Engagement of a licensed and professional-grade crypto company, Galaxy Digital, suggests that this was not an on-the-fly decision by some unknown early crypto enthusiast, but a planned attractor of liquidity. Galaxy Digital Galaxy Digital, founded by ex-hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz, is making more moves in the OTC Bitcoins markets and caretaking endeavors. This sale can be an indication that Galaxy could be a liquidity provider to those holders of legacies who want to exit or rebalance their portfolio. Read More: Galaxy Digital acquires crypto custody and asset infrastructure provider BitGo At this point, analysts believe that the whale is selling out of crypto, after a long period of appreciation, or making ready of another significant investment cycle. Market Signals from a Dormant Giant’s Move The timing of this move is significant. Bitcoin has been trading in the $115,000 – $123,000 range, and recent inflows and outflows from whale wallets have been closely tied to short-term price volatility. While this transfer didn’t happen on a public exchange, thus not immediately impacting order books, it still holds psychological weight. The crypto market often reacts strongly to old-wallet activity, especially when it involves such large volumes. If more dormant wallets become active, it could lead to: Increased sell pressure if large holders decide to cash out at current valuations. Renewed narratives around long-term holders exiting the market. Heightened security concerns if there’s any suspicion of private key compromise. So far, however, Bitcoin has remained relatively stable following the transfer, indicating limited panic , and possibly even growing confidence that these coins are being absorbed by institutional buyers. The Dormant Wallet Still Holds $1.3 Billion The other wallet participating in the transaction continue to have more than 11,000 BTC, which is worth over $1.3 billion, based on the on-chain data provided by Arkham Intelligence. This means the $1B transfer pun intended, actually might just be the beginning. That creates an opportunity if the holder wants to cash out their entire position, potentially a multi-billion-dollar liquidity event. But, if the move was simply for strategic relocation (like for custody, estate planning, or an invest partnership) the rest of the fortune may not be touched for the time being.

    "content": "An analyst known for betting against Bitcoin (BTC) says he’s still bearish after the flagship crypto asset’s major breakout. The analyst pseudonymously known as Capo tells his 128,461 Telegram subscribers that Bitcoin has demonstrated “remarkable strength” at a time when traditional markets are showing signs of weakness and are pointing to the potential formation of a top. Although he’s in the red, the trader believes he’ll make it through. “Euphoria around BTC is evident, and a reversal remains just a matter of time in my opinion. Currently, all my short positions are in a loss. Luckily, I use very low leverage, so to the disappointment of many, I’m not liquidated yet.” Capo has been betting that Bitcoin may fall to around $65,000, a level last recorded in November of 2024. The analyst says his bearish thesis is backed by the possibility of another unforeseen “black swan event” on the horizon. “Staying calm despite adversity. Not everything plays out immediately.” Bitcoin is trading at $118,926 at time of writing, up by approximately 10% over the past seven days but down by a few percentage points from the all-time high of just under $123,000 reached earlier this week. The trader is also analyzing the native token of BNB Chain (BNB). Capo says BNB is facing strong resistance and could fall by around 49% from the current price to a level last recorded in March of 2024. “Price is at the range high resistance. Mid-range support at $350 – $400.” BNB is trading at $693 at time of writing. Check Price Action Generated Image: Stablediffusion",

    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed its decision on allowing in-kind redemptions for Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, signaling cautious regulatory scrutiny in the crypto ETF space. This delay extends the review period, reflecting the SEC’s careful evaluation of the operational and investor protection implications tied to in-kind redemption mechanisms. According to COINOTAG, industry experts emphasize that this move highlights the ongoing balancing act between innovation and regulatory oversight in the evolving digital asset market. SEC delays decision on in-kind redemptions for Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, underscoring regulatory caution and shaping the future of crypto ETF structures. SEC’s Postponement on In-kind Redemptions: Implications for Bitcoin ETF Investors The recent SEC postponement regarding in-kind redemptions for Bitwise’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs marks a significant moment in the regulatory landscape of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. In-kind redemptions allow authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying assets, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, rather than cash. This mechanism is widely regarded as more tax-efficient and operationally streamlined compared to the cash redemption model currently employed by most spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the SEC’s decision to delay approval reflects its cautious stance on potential risks, including market manipulation and custody challenges associated with handling volatile digital assets directly. For investors, this means the anticipated benefits of reduced capital gains tax exposure and improved liquidity management remain on hold. The extended review period provides the SEC with additional time to scrutinize the proposal’s impact on market integrity and investor protection, signaling that regulatory prudence continues to guide the integration of crypto ETFs into mainstream finance. Understanding the SEC’s Concerns Over In-kind Redemptions In-kind redemptions, while beneficial in traditional ETF markets, present unique challenges in the crypto context. The SEC’s hesitation centers on ensuring robust safeguards against risks such as price manipulation and custody vulnerabilities. Since authorized participants would handle actual cryptocurrencies during the redemption process, the regulatory body is focused on verifying that these transactions do not compromise market fairness or investor security. Moreover, the SEC is evaluating the operational complexities introduced by direct crypto asset transfers, including the need for stringent custody solutions and transparent audit trails. These concerns highlight the regulator’s commitment to maintaining a resilient and trustworthy market environment as it navigates the novel terrain of digital asset ETFs. Broader Impact on Ethereum ETFs and the Crypto Market Ecosystem The SEC’s cautious approach to Bitwise’s in-kind redemption proposal extends beyond Bitcoin ETFs, influencing the broader crypto ETF ecosystem, particularly for Ethereum-based products. The approval or rejection of such mechanisms will likely set a precedent affecting future Ethereum ETF filings, which are still pending regulatory clearance. If in-kind redemptions gain approval, it could catalyze increased institutional adoption by offering more tax-efficient and liquid investment vehicles. Conversely, prolonged delays may constrain the operational models available to crypto ETFs, potentially limiting market innovation and investor options. This regulatory uncertainty underscores the importance of ongoing dialogue between issuers and regulators to foster a balanced framework that supports growth while safeguarding market participants. Bitwise’s Role as an Innovator in Crypto ETF Development Bitwise has positioned itself as a pioneer in the crypto ETF space, advocating for investor-friendly structures such as in-kind redemptions. Their filings and persistent engagement with the SEC demonstrate a commitment to advancing crypto investment products within regulatory parameters. While the current delay represents a setback, it also reflects the complexities involved in pioneering new financial instruments that bridge traditional and digital asset markets. By pushing for in-kind redemption approval, Bitwise aims to enhance operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness, potentially setting a new standard for crypto ETFs. Their efforts contribute to the maturation of the market and signal ongoing innovation despite regulatory hurdles. Navigating Regulatory Challenges and Market Opportunities in Crypto ETFs The SEC’s postponement highlights the multifaceted challenges facing crypto ETFs, including regulatory scrutiny, market volatility, and custody concerns. These factors necessitate a cautious approach to ensure investor protection and market stability. However, each regulatory review also represents an opportunity to refine product structures and enhance market legitimacy. Regulatory Scrutiny: Ensuring compliance with investor protection mandates remains paramount. Market Volatility: Crypto price fluctuations require robust risk management frameworks. Custody and Security: Secure asset custody solutions are critical for regulatory approval and investor confidence. On the opportunity side, ETFs serve as accessible gateways for traditional investors to enter the crypto market, fostering broader adoption. Continued innovation in ETF design, driven by issuer-regulator collaboration, promises to improve operational efficiency and investor outcomes over time. Conclusion The SEC’s delay in approving in-kind redemptions for Bitwise’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs underscores the complexity of integrating digital assets into regulated financial products. While the postponement may temper short-term expectations, it reflects a deliberate and necessary regulatory process focused on safeguarding investors and market integrity. As the crypto ETF landscape evolves, patience and continued innovation will be essential for achieving a balanced ecosystem that supports growth and protects stakeholders. Investors and market participants should remain attentive to forthcoming regulatory developments, which will shape the future accessibility and efficiency of crypto investment vehicles.",

    "content": "El Salvador and Pakistan have entered a groundbreaking Bitcoin alliance aimed at reshaping how the public sector operates and collaborates financially. This new partnership, which has caught the attention of the global crypto community, represents a significant step toward cross-border cooperation using blockchain technology. By leveraging their mutual interest in Bitcoin adoption, the two nations are exploring ways to modernize their public services and reduce dependency on traditional financial systems. El Salvador, the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is continuing to build on its pioneering role in crypto integration. Pakistan, while still navigating regulatory uncertainty, has shown increased openness toward blockchain use cases, particularly in financial inclusion and government services. The partnership suggests that both countries are seeking alternatives to the constraints imposed by global financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, which have traditionally set strict conditions for monetary aid and economic support. The alliance is also focused on public-private collaboration. It aims to build infrastructure and policies that facilitate the use of Bitcoin in governance, procurement, and possibly cross-border payments. This could reduce reliance on intermediaries, increase transparency, and create faster, more secure transactions. It also signals a move toward financial independence and technological innovation, particularly for developing economies looking to sidestep legacy systems and their limitations. Moreover, this development may set a precedent for other countries, especially those facing economic constraints or inflationary pressures. If successful, the El Salvador Pakistan partnership could become a model for how nations can cooperate through decentralized technologies. It reflects a shared vision of digital sovereignty and the strategic use of crypto to improve governmental efficiency and resilience. While the alliance is still in its early stages, it represents a strong commitment to exploring practical Bitcoin applications beyond speculation and investment. As both countries continue to refine the scope of their collaboration, the crypto world will be watching closely to see how this international use of Bitcoin might influence global policy and adoption trends.",

    "content": "The U.S. Marshals Service has revealed it holds only 28,988 Bitcoin, far less than the previously assumed 200,000 BTC, sparking widespread confusion about the government’s actual crypto assets. Speculation grows that significant portions of seized Bitcoin may be stored with private custodians like Coinbase or Anchorage, complicating federal asset tracking and transparency. Senator Cynthia Lummis has publicly criticized the government’s Bitcoin selloff, emphasizing the strategic disadvantage it poses in the global cryptocurrency landscape, according to COINOTAG reports. U.S. Marshals disclose holding only 28,988 BTC, raising questions about missing government Bitcoin and poor asset tracking amid calls for greater transparency. Discrepancies in U.S. Government Bitcoin Holdings and Their Implications The recent disclosure by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) that it holds approximately 28,988 Bitcoin, valued at around $3.4 billion, starkly contrasts with prior public estimates suggesting nearly 200,000 BTC under federal control. This significant discrepancy emerged following a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, highlighting potential gaps in government asset management. The USMS is the primary custodian for seized cryptocurrencies, receiving assets from agencies such as the FBI, IRS, and DOJ for safekeeping and eventual auction. The unexpectedly low figure raises critical questions about the whereabouts of the remaining Bitcoin and the accuracy of federal records. Private Custodians and Record-Keeping Challenges in Federal Crypto Management Industry insiders and analysts speculate that a substantial portion of the government’s Bitcoin may be held by private custodians like Coinbase and Anchorage Digital, with whom the U.S. government established partnerships in 2021 and 2024. This arrangement could explain why the USMS’s ledger reflects a smaller total than anticipated. However, concerns about the integrity of asset tracking persist, as reports indicate that the USMS still relies on outdated methods such as Excel spreadsheets for managing Bitcoin custody records. This antiquated approach may contribute to the confusion surrounding the true scale of government-held digital assets. Political Fallout and Strategic Ramifications of the Bitcoin Selloff Senator Cynthia Lummis has voiced strong criticism over the government’s decision to liquidate most of its Bitcoin holdings, arguing that retaining only around 29,000 BTC undermines the United States’ strategic financial position in the rapidly evolving global crypto market. This perspective aligns with former President Donald Trump’s advocacy for establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, as outlined in his March executive order mandating the transfer of seized digital assets to the U.S. Treasury. Despite these initiatives, current Bitcoin holdings fall significantly short of the envisioned reserve, fueling debate over federal crypto policy and asset management efficacy. Calls for Enhanced Transparency and Coordinated Federal Crypto Strategy Experts and policymakers emphasize the urgent need for improved transparency and coordination among federal agencies managing digital assets. The fragmented custody arrangements and inconsistent record-keeping practices undermine public trust and complicate efforts to assess the government’s true cryptocurrency portfolio. Advocates like David Sacks, a key figure in Trump’s crypto advisory team, have proposed budget-neutral strategies to bolster Bitcoin acquisition. However, without clear oversight and unified management, these proposals face significant implementation challenges. Conclusion The revelation of the U.S. Marshals Service’s limited Bitcoin holdings exposes critical vulnerabilities in federal cryptocurrency management, including fragmented custody, outdated tracking systems, and strategic missteps. Addressing these issues through enhanced transparency, centralized oversight, and robust asset tracking is essential for restoring confidence and strengthening the United States’ position in the global crypto economy. Stakeholders should closely monitor forthcoming policy developments to gauge the government’s commitment to securing and optimizing its digital asset portfolio.",

But the IMF did not support the plan, worried that cheap power for crypto could hurt the wider market. Recently, during the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas, Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy, praised Pakistan’s plan to build a national BTC reserve and stepped in to help build it.",

This lack of trust and efficiency creates an enormous demand, a vacuum, for a Web3 solution that offers fairness, transparency, and genuine community empowerment. Meet OpenFundNet: The Web3 Crowdfunding Revolution You’ve Been Waiting For Enter OpenFundNet (OFNT). This isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a decentralized crowdfunding powerhouse meticulously engineered to solve the core problems of its Web2 predecessors. Imagine a platform where transparency is paramount, where trust is built through community validation, and where value flows directly to creators and engaged participants. OpenFundNet is architected around a robust validator-based system, where expert community members vet projects, ensuring quality and viability. It’s built to be global, accessible, and fundamentally fairer. This is the exciting, cutting-edge solution the market is craving. No Platform Fees, Just Pure Funding: OpenFundNet’s First Knockout Punch Here’s where OpenFundNet delivers an immediate, undeniable win: ZERO platform transaction fees for project creators. Let that sink in. Compare this to the 5-10%+ skimmed by traditional platforms. With OFNT, 100% of the capital raised goes directly to fueling the project. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a revolutionary advantage that will make OpenFundNet the irresistible choice for innovators worldwide, driving a massive influx of quality projects onto the platform. More projects mean more activity, more utility, and more value for OFN token holders. Daily Token Emissions Reward Users: Backers & Validators Win Every Day! Traditional crowdfunding? You back a project, and if you’re lucky, you get a product a year later. OpenFundNet flips the script. The platform has a powerful daily token emission system, releasing 270,000 OFNT tokens every day. These rewards aren’t just for stakers; they’re split between Backers: Earn OFNT for actively funding verified projects. You’re not just a donor; you’re a rewarded stakeholder. Validators: Earn OFNT for their crucial work in evaluating projects and maintaining platform integrity. This continuous reward mechanism creates a vibrant, highly engaged ecosystem where participation is directly incentivized. It’s a win-win that traditional models simply can’t offer. Early Access = Bigger Gains: This is Where the FOMO Kicks In This is the core of the insider alert: OpenFundNet is not some distant dream; its presale is happening right now. Why is this critical? Because getting in on the ground floor of a project with such clear, disruptive advantages over an entrenched, multi-billion-dollar industry is how generational wealth is made in crypto. The “stealth phase” is ending. Those who recognize this paradigm shift and secure their OFNT tokens during the presale are positioning themselves for potentially astronomical returns as OpenFundNet inevitably captures market share from the old, inefficient systems. Think about getting into other foundational Web3 protocols before they were household names—this has that same electrifying potential. Presale Details & How to Join: Your Insider’s Guide to Getting In Accessing this presale opportunity is designed to be straightforward, cutting through the usual complexities: The Source: Your journey begins at the official OpenFundNet presale website. (As an insider, I must remind you to always verify links through their official Twitter/X, Telegram, or Discord.). Scammers are rampant; due diligence is your shield. Fuel Up: The presale primarily utilizes USDT for contributions, making it accessible to a global audience. Ensure your Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) is ready. Secure Your Stake: On the official presale page, you’ll connect your wallet, specify your OFNT token contribution, and confirm. The process is streamlined. Join the Inner Circle: For the latest presale updates, direct team interaction, and to connect with other early adopters, the OpenFundNet Discord channel is your primary hub. This is where the real-time alpha flows. Don’t Miss This: The Crowdfunding Revolution is Here, and OpenFundNet is Leading The shift from centralized, fee-heavy crowdfunding to decentralized, community-driven models isn’t a matter of if, but when. OpenFundNet, with its zero-fee structure, powerful daily token rewards, and validator-driven trust system, is demonstrably the superior model. It unequivocally wins against the outdated, inefficient traditional platforms. The May 2025 presale for OpenFundNet isn’t just an opportunity to buy a token; it’s a chance to become a foundational part of a platform that is set to redefine how innovation is funded globally. The supply of presale tokens is, by nature, limited. The urgency is real. Those who act decisively now, while this project is still relatively under the mainstream radar, are positioning themselves on the right side of a major disruptive wave. Don’t be the one reading about OpenFundNet’s triumphs six months from now, lamenting a missed opportunity. The future of crowdfunding is here, and its name is OpenFundNet. This is your signal.

This Coin Will Be appeared on BitcoinEthereumNews.com.Bitcoin and Ethereum may be preparing for their next bullish breakout, but if you’re hoping for life-changing returns, you might be looking in the wrong direction. With trillion-dollar market caps, neither BTC nor ETH is designed to deliver 100x moves anymore. Instead, the real explosion is happening quietly in the presale arena—and it’s being led by Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a meme coin turning heads with a roadmap that’s making even Dogecoin veterans do a double-take. Why LILPEPE Could Be 2025’s Biggest Crypto Gainer LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin—it’s an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 token with serious performance engineering. It offers near-zero gas fees, built-in sniper bot protection, and zero-tax tokenomics, all tailored for next-gen meme token ecosystems. As detailed by The Tribune India, the coin is backed by an ambitious roadmap designed to create lasting relevance in a market often defined by short-lived hype. The numbers speak for themselves. Stage 4 of the presale sold out quickly after raising over $3.3 million, and Stage 5, now priced at $0.0014, is 82.78% filled with over $5.3 million raised. Once 5.25 billion tokens are sold, the price jumps to $0.0015.

According to AInvest , even a modest rise to $0.233 would deliver a jaw-dropping 16,587% gain. Whales Are Buying, and FOMO Is Heating Up This isn’t just retail excitement. Whale wallets have been spotted accumulating millions of LILPEPE tokens as the project gains traction. Presale data shows large volume transactions fueling demand, and that’s not all—LILPEPE is also fueling community interest with a jaw-dropping $770,000 giveaway . Ten lucky winners will receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens each, generating more buzz for the brand and attracting thousands of new participants. Coverage from platforms like IndiaTimes and The Wire has only added to the growing media attention, with multiple outlets now placing LILPEPE on the shortlist of meme coins to watch before the 2025 bull run goes full throttle. BTC and ETH Will Rise—But Not Like This Bitcoin is expected to hold firm in the $100K–$110K range. Spot ETFs and institutional adoption will likely push it further, but a 2x from here would be impressive. Ethereum could potentially climb another three times with the expansion of Layer 2 and DeFi integration. But even in a bullish case, these giants are unlikely to deliver 100x returns again. By contrast, LILPEPE is still in its earliest days. With a price point of $0.0014 and a projected listing price of $0.003, early buyers are already looking at a structured profit. The fact that experts from Coinpedia and IndiaTimes are now comparing it to early-stage DOGE or SHIB only fuels the urgency. Final Word: BTC and ETH Might Rally, But LILPEPE Could Explode Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to continue pushing forward in 2025, but their returns will appear sluggish compared to LILPEPE’s rapid growth. Meme culture is alive, but what’s rare is seeing that culture backed by technology, structure, and community-focused incentives. LILPEPE has all three. It’s already proving itself in presale. It’s caught the attention of media platforms, whales, and crypto veterans alike. It’s now listed on CoinMarketCap , drawing global investor interest. And it’s designed to generate real value, not just laughs. With the 5th stage nearing completion, buying now at $0.0014 provides immediate upside before the token lists at $0.003, and potentially long-term upside that could exceed 166x. If you’re searching for the next big crypto gainer of 2025, don’t just watch Bitcoin and Ethereum move—ride LILPEPE as it rockets past them.
